    videoOne.description = "The Brief \n\nWe were commissioned by US record companies Stone’d records and S curve to provide the post production and VFX for Joss Stone’s music video ‘The High Road’. We had an extremely quick turn around of eight days. The video had been shot by an LA based company during the daytime and they had used heavy amounts of smoke and ran into problems with post production and VFX . The management, labels and artist wanted the video to be at night and for us to composite an array of VFX and 3D animation into the video. We were therefore commissioned to take over from the LA production company. \n\nThe Process \n\nOur in house team of 3D/VFX artists and editors worked laboriously throughout the post production stages. We completed an array of post production and VFX/animation techniques including, Rotoscoping, VFX work, animation (2D/3D) lighting, grading and skin enhancements. \n\nThe Result \n\nThe video to date has had over a million hits and has lead to further commissions by Stone’d records and S curve. Joss Stone stated ‘Lovelove Films have done an amazing job’."

    videoTwo.description = "The Brief \n\nAfter successfully completing two projects for Stone’d Records, LoveLove Films were contacted with the opportunity to create a music video from concept to completion for the record label’s prime artist Joss Stone. The label came to us with the most popular track on her latest album The Love We Had, wanting us to complete the video in time to coincide with the song’s worldwide release as a single. \n\nThe Process \n\nLoveLove’s in house writers came up with a concept that perfectly suited the emotionally powerful and heart wrenching song, with the idea of interior rain representing the singer’s emotional state, which physically manifests itself inside her home, destroying all of her personal possessions. LoveLove then spent time constructing the devices that would be needed to bring the video’s concept to life. The rain machine was made by the visual effects team out of store bought items. Location recce’s were conducted to find the perfect apartment to suit the video. LoveLove Films then shot the majority of the music video over two days, filming all of Joss’ footage and everything in the apartment over this period. Finally practical special effects footage was filmed at a separate location, which was able to be made indistinguishable from the apartment setting. As well as the music video LoveLove produced a behind the scenes video, a series of videos for the products featured in the official music video and a lyric music video for The Love We Had.\n\nThe Result \n\nThe video has been a huge success. It has been described by many people as the best music video that Joss Stone has ever made. It has also received huge critical praise from publications such as The Telegraph, The Daily Mail, OK Magazine, The Sun, Promo News and many others. The video has also yielded a high number of viewers, gaining over 500,000 views within three weeks of being uploaded onto Vevo and Youtube. The music video currently has over 4.5 Million views on VEVO. It has also been screened on television channels around the world. In the UK alone it is being shown on the music channels MTV, MTV Music, VH1 and others."

We had a completely open brief to create a music video for the track ‘In Your Head’. \n\nThe Process \n\nThe video is made entirely out of photos that we shot in house that have been stylistically animated. We consulted with the band and management on brand ideologies. We created an animated 2D journey where Gabby and fellow band members defeat the Evil Ring Master to rescue animals from a Victorian styled circus.\nThe video was relatively low budget, therefore, we engaged with the artist to raise funds through crowd sourcing. LoveLove came up with the idea that Gabby Young & the Other Animals’ fans could fund the video through donations in exchange the fans would send high res images to LoveLove. These images would in turn be animated and the fans would appear in the music video. Not only was this a great way to fund the music video but it meant that the fans would directly engage with the music video. We also wanted the video to be interactive and we made three interactive endings where the fans could choose which animal to save.\nFurther to the video we created three Games that the fans could play on Gabby Young’s website driving traffic directly from the videos hosted on Youtube. \n\nThe Result \n\nThe video resulted in over 45,000 hits on YouTube alone and gained much press regarding the interactive elements including……./n“LoveLove are an amazing team to work with – not only did they deliver a video that far surpassed my expectations but they were professional, creative, full of original ideas and a joy to work with.
